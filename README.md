# How It Works

Welcome to the **Dragon Forge**, where you stake your Dragons in a staking contract to harvest **Soulfire**. After **30 days of staking**, you'll gather enough Soulfire to mint a new immortal entity: a **Dwagin**.

**Dwaginz** are exclusively mintable with Soulfire, and the only way to harvest Soulfire is by staking your Dragons.

## TL;DR Overview

- **Stake at least five Dragons for 30 days** to receive enough Soulfire to mint a Dwagin.
- **Staking begins:** Wednesday, Jan 22nd.
- **Minting opens:** Friday, Feb 21st.
- **Minting & staking will remain open** until all Dwaginz are claimed.
- **Six rarity tiers** exist, requiring increasing amounts of Soulfire. Higher tiers offer **better chances** at minting **Legendary or Mega Dwaginz** (details below).

## Staking & Points Breakdown

- **Each staked Dragon earns 1 Soulfire per hour**.
- **Dragons can be unstaked at any time**, and all harvested Soulfire remains linked to your profile.
- **When staked, Dragons are locked in the contract** and will not appear in your wallet.

**Contract Address:**  
`0x44eB...0dc6`
